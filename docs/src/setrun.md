# setrun.py

## Introduction
The `setrun.py` file is the parameter file used to specify a D-Claw simulation. Many elements of the `setrun.py` are not unique to D-Claw but are inherited from Clawpack. See [this page](https://www.clawpack.org/setrun_geoclaw.html) for a detailed description of these elements.

The data model for the D-Claw specific parts of the setrun are defines by assigning values to attributes of the following five classes:

- [DClawInputData](#dclaw.data.DClawInputData)
- [QinitDClawData](#dclaw.data.QinitDClawData)
- [AuxInitDClawData](#dclaw.data.AuxInitDClawData)
- [PInitDClawInputData](#dclaw.data.PInitDClawInputData)
- [FlowGradesData](#dclaw.data.FlowGradesData)

See the [API documentation of the D-Claw data model](#dclaw.data) for additional details.

## State and auxiliary variable index

D-Claw stores the state variables in an array called **q** and the auxiliary variables in an array called **aux**. There may be a different number of elements of **aux** depending on how D-Claw is specified in the `setrun.py`.

The elements of **q** are defined as in the following table. See the [theory](theory.md) page for further explanation.

:::

The user-facing elements of **aux** are listed in the following table. The numbering depends on the value for ``coordinate_system``, which is a [geoclaw parameter](https://www.clawpack.org/setrun_geoclaw.html#general-geo-parameters) that toggles between horizontal units of meters (`geo_data.coordinate_system = 1`) and latitude-longitude (`geo_data.coordinate_system = 2`).

In addition to the user-facing elements of **aux**, other elements are internally used for the calculation of spatially-variable quantities.
