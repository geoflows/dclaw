# Theory

This page describes the equations solved by D-Claw. A user interested in the details of the equation derivation is referred to Iverson and George (2014). Those interested in an explanation of the numerical implementation are referred to George and Iverson (2014).

## State variables and auxiliary variables

D-Claw considers the flow of material under gravity ({math}`\vec{g} = (g_x,g_y,g_z)^\mathrm{T}`) with thickness {math}`h`, x- and y- directed velocities {math}`u` and {math}`v`, solid volume fraction {math}`m`, and basal pore pressure {math}`p_b` over an arbitrary surface {math}`b`. Optionally, entrainment and segregation are implemented. The depth of entrained material is given by {math}`\Delta b` (positive indicating entrainment has occurred). Segregation considers two species fractions {math}`A` and {math}`B` with {math}`\chi` representing the fraction of species {math}`A`.

The variables which vary in space and time are:

## Core equations

D-Claw solves the following set of equations. See Iverson and George (2014) and George and Iverson (2014) for derivation, explanation, and references.


```{math}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial y}=
\varphi_1
```

```{math}
\frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left ( hu^2\right ) +
\kappa \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left (\frac{1}{2} g_z h^2\right ) +
\frac{\partial (huv)}{\partial y} +  
\frac{h(1-\kappa)}{\rho}\frac{\partial p_b}{\partial x} =
\varphi_2
```

```{math}
\frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial (huv)}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left ( hv^2 \right )  +
\kappa\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left (\frac{1}{2}  g_z h^2\right ) +  
\frac{h(1-\kappa)}{\rho}\frac{\partial p_b}{\partial y} =
\varphi_3
```

```{math}
\frac{\partial (hm)}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial (hum)}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial (hvm)}{\partial y} =
\varphi_4
```

```{math}
\frac{\partial p_b}{\partial t} -
\rho g_z\varrho u \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}  +
\rho g_z\varrho \frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial x} +
u\frac{\partial p_b}{\partial x} -
\rho g_z\varrho  v \frac{\partial h}{\partial y}  +
\rho g_z\varrho \frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial y} +
v\frac{\partial p_b}{\partial y}= \varphi_5
```

where {math}`\varphi_1`,  {math}`\varphi_2`,  {math}`\varphi_3`,  {math}`\varphi_4`, and {math}`\varphi_5`  represent the source terms.

The bulk density of the flow, {math}`\rho`, is calculated based on the fluid and solid densities, {math}`\rho_f` and {math}`\rho_s`, respectively.

```{math}
\rho = \rho_s m + (1-m)\rho_f
```

The lateral pressure coefficient {math}`\kappa` is typically set to {math}`\kappa=1`.

The source terms {math}`\varphi_1--\varphi_5` are defined as

```{math}
\varphi_1 = \frac{(\rho-\rho_f)}{\rho} D
```

```{math}
\varphi_2 = hg_x + uD\frac{(\rho-\rho_f)}{\rho}-\frac{(\tau_{s,x} + \tau_{f,x})}{\rho}
```

```{math}
\varphi_3 = hg_y + vD\frac{(\rho-\rho_f)}{\rho}-\frac{(\tau_{s,y} + \tau_{f,y})}{\rho}
```

```{math}
\varphi_4 = -Dm\frac{\rho_f}{\rho}
```

```{math}
\varphi_5 = \zeta D - \frac{3}{\alpha h}||(u,v)^\mathrm{T}||\tan\psi
```

where {math}`\vec{\tau}_s = (\tau_{s,x},\tau_{s,y})^\mathrm{T}` and {math}`\vec{\tau}_f = (\tau_{f,x},\tau_{f,y})^\mathrm{T}` are the shear tractions exerted by the solid phase and fluid phase, respectively, at the base of the flow, {math}`\alpha` is the debris' elastic compressibility, {math}`\psi` is the granular dilatancy angle, and {math}`D` is the granular dilation rate.

For brevity, the variables {math}`\varrho` in and {math}`\varrho` are defined.

```{math}
	\varrho = \frac{(\rho_f + 3\rho)}{4\rho }
```

```{math}
	\zeta = \frac{3}{2\alpha h} + \frac{g_z \rho_f(\rho -\rho_f)}{4\rho}
```

{math}`\alpha` is calculated based on {math}`m`, {math}`h`, and {math}`p_b`

```{math}
\alpha = \frac{a}{m(\rho g_z h - p_b + \sigma_0)}
```

where {math}`a` and {math}`\sigma_0` are constants (typically set to {math}`a=0.01-0.3`, and {math}`\sigma_0=1000` Pa).

{math}`D` is proportional to the excess pressure

```{math}
D = -\frac{2k}{h\mu}\left ( p_b - \rho_f g_z h \right )
```
where {math}`k` is the hydraulic permeability which varies based on {math}`m`, and {math}`\mu`  is the effective shear viscosity of the pore-fluid.

A form for {math}`k` is
```{math}
k = k_r\exp{\frac{m-m_r}{0.04}}
```
where {math}`k_r` and {math}`m_r` are the reference permeability and solid volume fraction.

The fluid and solid components of basal resistance {math}`\vec{\tau}_f` and {math}`\vec{\tau}_f` are calculated as

```{math}
\vec{\tau}_f = \frac{2\mu\left ( 1-m \right )}{h}(u,v)^\mathrm{T},
```

```{math}
\vec{\tau}_s = \sigma_e \tan(\phi + \psi)\frac{(u,v)^\mathrm{T}}{||(u,v)^\mathrm{T}||}.
```

with {math}`\sigma_e = \rho g_z h - p_b`, the basal effective normal stress.

{math}`\psi` is the granular dilatancy angle:

```{math}
\tan\psi = m - \frac{m_\mathrm{crit}}{1+\sqrt{N}}
```

{math}`m_\mathrm{crit}` is the critical-state solid fraction and {math}`N` is a dimensionless variable defined as

```{math}
N = \frac{\mu \dot{\gamma}}{\rho_s \dot{\gamma}^2 \delta^2 + \sigma_e}.
```

where {math}`\dot{\gamma}` is the shear rate and {math}`\delta` is a characteristic length scale associated with grain collisions.


## Additional equations

The elements of D-Claw described in this section are experimental and may change. They are optional and are not enabled by default.

### Segregation

Fully representing the influence of segregation on flow dynamics requires (1) an expression of how flow behavior results in the segregation of different particle species and (2) an expression of how flow behavior is affected by resulting particle species ratios.

To treat the first element, the influence of flow behavior on the segregation of particle species, D-Claw implements a model developed by Gray and Kokelaar (2010). This model considers the segregation of two particle species (species {math}`A` and {math}`B`) in a depth-averaged flow with a linear velocity profile defined as

```{math}
u(z) = (1-\beta)\bar{u} + 2\beta\bar{u}\frac{z}{h}
```
where {math}`\beta` is a constant between 0 (plug flow) and 1 (simple shear) and {math}`\bar{u}` is the depth-averaged velocity.

As the mixture shears, species {math}`A` moves to the surface of the flow, and is preferentially advected by the flow. The lateral transport of {math}`\chi`, the fraction of species {math}`A` is described by the following equation, which, for brevity, shows only x-directed transport.

```{math}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(h\chi) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(h \chi u) -
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left (\beta h \chi u \left( 1-\chi\right) \right)=0
```

The representation of the feedback between the value of {math}`\chi` and flow behavior is highly experimental (c.f., Jones et al., 2023).

### Entrainment

Multiple options for entrainment are present in D-Claw. A user specifies a spatially variable value of the thickness of material available for entrainment, {math}`h_e`. An entrainment rate, {math}`\frac{\partial h_e}{\partial t}` is calculated if {math}`h_e` is less than the thickness of material that has already been entrained, {math}`\Delta b`.

The options for {math}`\frac{\partial h_e}{\partial t}` are:
