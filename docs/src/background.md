D-Claw is in fortran with a python wrapper

A user should expect to read the clawpack documentation.


## Model, Numerics, Application

The D-Claw model is the combination of
- mathematical equations
- Numerical methods
- Software implementations


Any indivudual simulation run with the D-claw model requires the
specification of parameter values (physical and numerical), and
initial and boundary conditions.

Each simulation is typically called an "application" and is run in an
application directory
