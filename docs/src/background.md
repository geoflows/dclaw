List the two D-Claw citations

D-Claw builds on clawpack/amrclaw/geoclaw

List the Clawpack/amrclaw/geoclaw citations

D-Claw is in fortran with a python wrapper

A user should expect to read the clawpack documentation.

## Model, Numerics, Application

The D-Claw model is the combination of
- Mathematical equations
- Numerical methods
- Software implementation


Any individual simulation run with the D-claw model requires the
specification of parameter values (physical and numerical), and
initial and boundary conditions.

Each simulation is typically called an "application" and is run in an
application directory
